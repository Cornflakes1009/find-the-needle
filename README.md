Find the needle in a haystack!


This is a game based on the old saying of trying to find something really small in a difficult place.



How to play: 

The game generates a random number of haystacks and one of them hides the needle. Click on each one to smash it down to look for the needs. You get 3 guesses and then it's game over. You can click restart and try it again. Happy playing!

This game was an extra practice assignment in my coding class when learning jQuery.
